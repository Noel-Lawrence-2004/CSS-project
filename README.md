The Digital Certificate Simulation project is a comprehensive system designed to emulate the process of digitally signing and verifying PDF certificates for secure online transactions or document authentication.

In this simulation, a digital certificate in PDF format is taken as input. The certificate's contents are hashed to generate a unique digital fingerprint, ensuring the integrity of the document. This hash is then encrypted using a private key, creating a digital signature that uniquely identifies the sender and guarantees the authenticity of the document.

Upon receiving the signed PDF certificate, the client-side application decodes the signature using the corresponding public key. It then hashes the original contents of the PDF to generate another fingerprint. Finally, it compares this new hash with the decrypted signature to verify the integrity and authenticity of the document.

This simulation project provides a hands-on understanding of digital certificate processes, including hashing, encryption, and verification, crucial for ensuring secure communication and document exchange in digital environments.
